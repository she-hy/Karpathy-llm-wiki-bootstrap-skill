# Karpathy LLM Wiki Bootstrap

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

An installable skill and a working reference implementation for building persistent, LLM-maintained Markdown wikis.

![Cover image for Karpathy LLM Wiki Bootstrap](./cover-image/llm-wiki/cover.png)

The most important thing here is not just the bootstrap skill, but **the worked example**. Starting from [karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md](./karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md), the LLM incrementally compiles source material into [llm-wiki/](./llm-wiki)—growing an [index](./llm-wiki/wiki/index.md), a [log](./llm-wiki/wiki/log.md), concept pages, comparison pages, and synthesis pages. The point is not a one-off summary, but a **maintainable knowledge artifact**.

That same pattern works for articles, papers, research reports, and books:

- keep raw evidence in `raw/`
- keep evolving understanding in `wiki/`
- use **ingest**, **query**, and **lint** to keep the structure alive over time

## What This Repo Contains

This repository has two closely related parts:

- [skill/](./skill) is the installable skill package. Use it to bootstrap your own wiki.
- [llm-wiki/](./llm-wiki) is a real example wiki created with that skill and then maintained through the ingest, query, and lint loop.

That split is intentional: `skill/` is the reusable product, while `llm-wiki/` shows the pattern in practice.

## Quick Install

Recommended:

```bash
npx skills add nanzhipro/Karpathy-llm-wiki-bootstrap-skill@llm-wiki-bootstrap
```

Non-interactive user-level install:

```bash
npx skills add nanzhipro/Karpathy-llm-wiki-bootstrap-skill@llm-wiki-bootstrap -g -y
```

Note:

- Use `npx skills ...` (plural), not `npx skill ...`. `skill` is a different CLI and will not handle this repository specifier correctly.
- If the skill is already installed and you just want the latest version, run `npx skills update` or `npx skills update llm-wiki-bootstrap`.

## First Run Example

Here is the simplest first-time workflow, using [karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md](./karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md) as the seed source.

The single source of truth is always `SCHEMA.md`. `AGENTS.md` (Codex) and `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) are generated as thin pointers that redirect to it. The example below uses OpenAI Codex, so an `AGENTS.md` pointer is present; if you select Claude Code, a `CLAUDE.md` pointer is generated instead. Multiple runtimes can coexist — all pointers read from the same `SCHEMA.md`.

1. In your agent, trigger the skill:

   > `bootstrap a wiki`

2. When the skill asks its setup questions, choose values like these:

   - Domain: `Research topic`
   - Wiki name: `llm-wiki-demo`
   - Agent: `OpenAI Codex`
   - Editor: `Obsidian`
   - Source types: `Web articles`
   - Output location: `Current directory`

3. After the wiki scaffold is created, copy the seed source into the new raw folder:

   ```bash
   cp karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md llm-wiki-demo/raw/
   ```

4. Then tell the agent:

   > `Read llm-wiki-demo/SCHEMA.md, then ingest llm-wiki-demo/raw/karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md`

   (Runtimes that auto-discover `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` will be redirected to `SCHEMA.md` automatically.)

5. After the first ingest, inspect these files:

   - `llm-wiki-demo/wiki/index.md`
   - `llm-wiki-demo/wiki/concept-table.md`
   - `llm-wiki-demo/wiki/log.md`
   - `llm-wiki-demo/wiki/overview.md`

What you should expect after that first run:

- a source summary page under `wiki/sources/`
- new concept or entity pages if the agent identifies them
- an updated index, concept table, log, and overview

If you want to see what a completed run looks like before trying it yourself, open [llm-wiki/](./llm-wiki).

Tip for a Chinese-language wiki:

If you want the wiki to be compiled in Chinese from the start, you can simply tell the agent:

> `使用中文编译 karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md`

## Why This Pattern Exists

Most LLM document workflows stop at RAG: upload files, retrieve a few chunks at question time, and synthesize an answer from scratch. That works—but it does not build lasting structure.

This project packages a different model:

- Raw sources stay **immutable**
- The agent incrementally **compiles** knowledge into a wiki
- The wiki becomes a **persistent artifact** that grows over time
- Useful answers get filed back into the wiki instead of disappearing into chat history

**The result:** a knowledge base that compounds instead of resetting on every query.

## System Model

The full system has four layers:

| Layer | Location | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill package | `skill/` | Bootstrap logic, templates, and workflow rules |
| Raw sources | `raw/` | Immutable evidence layer |
| Schema | `SCHEMA.md` | Single source of truth — the operating contract for every agent |
| Pointers | `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Optional thin redirects to `SCHEMA.md`, one per runtime you want to support |
| Wiki pages | `wiki/` | Maintained knowledge layer |

The skill creates the bottom three layers inside a new wiki.

The example in `llm-wiki/` shows what that looks like after the system has already been used.

## The Reference Wiki

[llm-wiki/](./llm-wiki) is not placeholder content. It is a working example generated from the skill and then maintained as a living wiki.

Current structure:

```text
llm-wiki/
├── SCHEMA.md            # Single source of truth for operating rules
├── AGENTS.md            # Thin pointer for OpenAI Codex → SCHEMA.md
├── raw/
│   ├── Karpathy x.md
│   └── llm-wiki-pattern.md
└── wiki/
    ├── index.md
   ├── concept-table.md
    ├── log.md
    ├── overview.md
    ├── concepts/
    ├── entities/
    ├── comparisons/
    ├── sources/
    └── synthesis/
```

Useful entry points:

- [llm-wiki/SCHEMA.md](./llm-wiki/SCHEMA.md) for the authoritative agent instructions
- [llm-wiki/AGENTS.md](./llm-wiki/AGENTS.md) to see what a thin runtime pointer looks like
- [llm-wiki/wiki/index.md](./llm-wiki/wiki/index.md) for the catalog the agent navigates through
- [llm-wiki/wiki/concept-table.md](./llm-wiki/wiki/concept-table.md) for the maintained concept map
- [llm-wiki/wiki/log.md](./llm-wiki/wiki/log.md) for the chronological operation history
- [llm-wiki/wiki/overview.md](./llm-wiki/wiki/overview.md) for the current top-level synthesis

If you want to understand the pattern quickly, `llm-wiki/` is the best place to inspect it in action.

## Origin And Source Lineage

The underlying idea comes from Karpathy's original LLM Wiki note:

- Original gist: <https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f>
- Repository copy: [karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md](./karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md)

The example wiki is grounded in that note. Source lineage in this repo:

| Source | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md](./karpathy-llm-wiki-original.md) | Reference copy of the original idea |
| [llm-wiki/raw/llm-wiki-pattern.md](./llm-wiki/raw/llm-wiki-pattern.md) | Example-local raw source derived from it |
| [llm-wiki/raw/Karpathy x.md](./llm-wiki/raw/Karpathy%20x.md) | Shows how additional sources get absorbed |

Clean framing for public-facing explanation:

1. The **skill** packages the method
2. The **example wiki** demonstrates the method in use
3. The **corpus** starts from Karpathy's idea, then grows through new sources

## Recommended Installation Layout

Use `.agent/skills/` as the canonical installation location.

If Claude, Codex, or another runtime expects a separate discovery directory, link that runtime back to the same installed copy instead of duplicating files.

```text
.agent/
└── skills/
    └── llm-wiki-bootstrap/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── references/
```

Example symlinks:

```bash
ln -s /absolute/path/to/.agent/skills/llm-wiki-bootstrap ~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki-bootstrap
ln -s /absolute/path/to/.agent/skills/llm-wiki-bootstrap ~/.codex/skills/llm-wiki-bootstrap
```

> **Principle:** keep one real installed copy and point every runtime back to it.

## What The Skill Generates

When you bootstrap a new wiki, the generated structure looks like this:

```text
{wiki-name}/
├── raw/
├── wiki/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── concept-table.md
│   ├── log.md
│   └── overview.md
├── SCHEMA.md            # Always generated — single source of truth
├── {pointer-files}      # Optional, one per selected runtime
└── .gitignore
```

`SCHEMA.md` is always generated. For each runtime you select during setup, the skill adds a thin pointer file that redirects to `SCHEMA.md`:

| Agent | Pointer File | Points to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `./SCHEMA.md` |
| OpenAI Codex | `AGENTS.md` | `./SCHEMA.md` |
| Copilot (VS Code) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `../SCHEMA.md` |
| Other / generic | _(no pointer)_ | agent reads `SCHEMA.md` directly |

All rules live in `SCHEMA.md`. Pointers never duplicate rule content — so you can safely add a second runtime at any time by dropping in another pointer file.

## Core Operations

| Operation | Trigger | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest | `"ingest raw/{file}"` | Turns a source into summaries, entities, concepts, links, index updates, and a log entry |
| Query | Ask a domain question | Reads the index, opens relevant pages, and answers with citations |
| Lint | `"lint"` or `"health check"` | Audits contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, and missing links |

## Preferences With EXTEND.md

The skill reads preferences from `EXTEND.md` before bootstrap, ingest, query, lint, or optional BM25 setup. The first file found wins:

| Priority | Path | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `.llm-wiki-bootstrap/EXTEND.md` | Project / wiki root |
| 2 | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/llm-wiki-bootstrap/EXTEND.md` | XDG |
| 3 | `$HOME/.llm-wiki-bootstrap/EXTEND.md` | User home |

If no preferences exist, the skill runs first-time setup instead of silently using defaults. The main configurable area today is the optional BM25 search layer: reminder mode, thresholds, rebuild policy, indexed paths, chunk size, fallback behavior, and export defaults.

## Optional BM25 Search Layer

BM25 is an optional, local, rebuildable full-text search layer for larger wikis. It is useful when `wiki/index.md` and direct file search are no longer enough to reliably find all relevant material.

Recommended trigger thresholds live in `EXTEND.md` and can be changed by the user:

```yaml
bm25:
  mode: auto_prompt
  thresholds:
    source_count: 30
    wiki_page_count: 150
    wiki_text_chars: 250000
    index_lines: 500
    query_read_pages: 15
```

Modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auto_prompt` | Ask whether to initialize BM25 when configured thresholds are reached |
| `manual` | Never ask automatically; only set up BM25 when explicitly requested |
| `off` | Disable BM25 checks and reminders |
| `enabled` | Use BM25 when available; ask to initialize if missing |
| `required` | Require BM25 for ingest/query/lint once configured |

How the LLM uses BM25:

```text
User question
  -> LLM extracts terms, entities, and intent
  -> BM25 returns candidate wiki chunks
  -> LLM opens the matching wiki pages
  -> LLM reads full context and follows wikilinks
  -> LLM answers with citations to wiki pages
```

BM25 is not a source of truth. It does not judge claims, replace `SCHEMA.md`, replace the wiki, or produce final answers. It helps the LLM find candidate passages. The LLM must still read the full wiki pages before answering.

When the user chooses to initialize BM25, the wiki gets:

```text
scripts/wiki_fts.py
indexes/README.md
indexes/fts.sqlite      # rebuildable, ignored by git
exports/                # rebuildable exports, ignored by git
```

Common commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py doctor
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py build
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py rebuild
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py search "query text" --limit 10
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py stats
```

Full export:

```bash
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py export --format jsonl --out exports/bm25-chunks.jsonl
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py export --format csv --out exports/bm25-chunks.csv
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py export --format markdown --out exports/bm25-report.md
```

Exports contain indexed chunks and metadata, not static BM25 scores. BM25 scores are computed per query. Treat `fts.sqlite` and exported files as sensitive if the wiki contains private material.
