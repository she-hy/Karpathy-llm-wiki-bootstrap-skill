# Ingest Workflow — Reference

Detailed protocol for ingesting a new source into the wiki. The schema file contains a condensed version; this document covers edge cases and rationale.

## Trigger

User adds a file to `raw/` and instructs the LLM to process it. Trigger phrases: "ingest", "process", "add this source", "read this and update the wiki".

## Pre-flight Checks

0. Load `EXTEND.md` preferences using `references/config/extend-schema.md`. If no preference file exists, run first-time preference setup before continuing.
1. Verify file exists in `raw/`
2. Determine file type using this table:

| Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown / text | Read directly |
| PDF | Extract text (ask user for tool if unavailable) |
| Image | Describe contents, note as visual source |
| CSV / JSON | Summarize structure and key data points |
| Other | Ask user how to handle |

1. Check `wiki/log.md` — has this source been ingested before? If yes, ask user: "This source was ingested on {date}. Re-ingest (update) or skip?"
2. If `bm25.mode: auto_prompt`, check whether the wiki has crossed the configured BM25 thresholds. If yes, ask whether to initialize BM25 before ingest. If the user agrees, follow `references/workflows/bm25.md`.

## Core Sequence

### Step 1: Read and Comprehend

Read the entire source. Produce internal notes (not written to file):

- **Primary language** of the source (e.g. Chinese, English, Japanese). All wiki pages created or updated from this source MUST be written in this language. Structural elements (YAML keys, `type` values, filenames, table column headers, section headings in index/log) stay in English.
- 3-5 key claims or data points
- Named entities (people, orgs, products, places)
- Concepts and frameworks introduced
- Anything that contradicts or extends existing wiki knowledge

### Step 2: Discuss with User

Present 2-3 bullet summary of key takeaways. Ask:

- "Anything I should emphasize or de-emphasize?"
- "Any corrections to my reading?"

This step is skippable if user says "ingest silently" or "batch ingest".

### Step 3: Create Source Summary Page

Write `wiki/sources/{slug}.md`:

```yaml
---
title: "{source title}"
type: source-summary
created: {date}
updated: {date}
sources: [{filename}]
tags: [{auto-generated tags}]
---
```

Note: `sources` uses filenames only (e.g. `[article.md]`), not full paths like `raw/article.md`.

Body structure:

1. **Summary** — 2-3 paragraph overview
2. **Key Claims** — numbered list with inline quotes
3. **Entities Mentioned** — list with wikilinks
4. **Concepts** — list with wikilinks
5. **Notable Quotes** — verbatim with page/section references
6. **Limitations / Bias** — note if single-perspective, dated, etc.

### Step 4: Ripple Updates

For each entity and concept the source touches:

- If BM25 is enabled, search for existing related pages before creating new pages:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py search "{candidate entity or concept}" --limit 10
  ```

- If page exists → add new information, update `sources` frontmatter, revise summary if needed
- If page doesn't exist → create it with information from this source
- If source contradicts existing content → add contradiction block to both pages

**Contradiction format**:

```markdown
> ⚠️ CONTRADICTION (added {date})
> {Source A} claims: "{quote or paraphrase}"
> {Source B} claims: "{quote or paraphrase}"
> Resolution: {pending | Source B supersedes (newer data) | both valid in different contexts}
```

### Step 5: Update Concept Table

Update `wiki/concept-table.md` for every concept created, renamed, merged,
split, deleted, or materially revised during ingest.

For each concept row, keep these fields current:

| Field | Maintenance rule |
| --- | --- |
| `Concept` | Link to the durable concept page under `wiki/concepts/`. |
| `Working definition` | One concise, evidence-aware definition. |
| `Role in this wiki` | Why the concept matters to the current knowledge base. |
| `Sources` | Source filenames only, matching page frontmatter style. |
| `Related pages` | Important concepts, entities, comparisons, or synthesis pages. |
| `Status` | `high confidence`, `single-source`, `tentative`, `needs sources`, or `contradicted`. |
| `Maintenance note` | What future ingest or lint should watch for. |

Keep concept rows sorted alphabetically. If the new source changes the concept
landscape, also update the `Concept Clusters` section.

### Step 6: Update Index

Add source entry to `wiki/index.md` Sources table. Add/update entity and concept entries.

### Step 7: Update Log

Append structured entry to `wiki/log.md`.

### Step 8: Revise Overview

Re-read `wiki/overview.md` and assess whether the new source changes the big picture. If yes, revise. If no, skip. Even for small wikis, keep the overview current — a single source can reshape the narrative.

### Step 9: Refresh Search Index

If BM25 is enabled and `auto_rebuild_after_ingest: true`:

```bash
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py build
python3 scripts/wiki_fts.py stats
```

If rebuild fails, do not roll back wiki edits. Record the failure in `wiki/log.md` and fall back to `wiki/index.md` plus `rg` for subsequent navigation.

## Batch Ingest

When processing multiple sources at once:

1. Process sequentially (not in parallel — each source may affect the next)
2. Skip Step 2 (user discussion) unless contradictions are found
3. Consolidate log entries into a single batch entry
4. Revise `wiki/concept-table.md` and `wiki/overview.md` once at the end, not after each source
5. Rebuild BM25 once at the end if enabled and configured for automatic rebuild

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Source overlaps significantly with existing source | Note overlap, only add genuinely new information |
| Source is a primary document (e.g., legal text, spec) | Summarize but also link to raw file for exact wording |
| Source is in a different language than existing wiki pages | Write this source's wiki pages in the source's own language. For cross-source pages that mix languages, use the majority language or ask the user. |
| Source contains images | Describe key images in text, reference image files in `raw/assets/` |
| Source is very long (book chapter, 50+ pages) | Break into sections, create one summary page with section headers |
